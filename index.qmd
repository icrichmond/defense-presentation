## Thank you 


## Nature is a key part of our cities 

- the integration of nature with the built environment creates novel ecosystems 
- requires inter and trans disciplinary studies to be understood 

## There are many benefits of urban nature 

- ecosystem services 
- regulating 
- cultural 
- vary across spatial and temporal contexts 

## These benefits are not equitably distributed 
- historically 
- affected by urban form and spatial context


## Trees provide many of urban nature's benefits 
- different benefits 
- affected by the composition and structure of the forest

## Gaps?? 


## Chapter 1: Land-use history causes differences in park nighttime cooling capacity and forest structure

1. What are the effects of historical land-use on current park forest
structure, diversity, and consequently the capacity to provide cooling? 

2. How do surrounding communities differ around parks of each historical land-use type, and what are the implications for equitable access to cooling?

## Obtaining the historical land-uses of Montreal parks 

## Measuring capacity for cooling & forest structure
