## Nature is a key part of our cities 

- the integration of nature with the built environment creates novel ecosystems 
- requires inter and trans disciplinary studies to be understood 

## There are many benefits of urban nature 

- ecosystem services 
- regulating 
- cultural 
- vary across spatial and temporal contexts 

## These benefits are not equitably distributed 
- historically 
- affected by urban form and spatial context


## Trees provide many of urban nature's benefits 
- different benefits 
- affected by the composition and structure of the forest

## Gaps??

- cities are temporally dynamics 
- the redevelopment of urban spaces is a social process

## We asked: 

::: incremental

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

1.  What are the effects of historical land-use on current park forest structure, diversity, and consequently the capacity to provide cooling? 
2.  How do surrounding communities differ around parks of each historical land-use type, and what are the implications for equitable access to cooling?

## Put parks everywhere! ... with intentional, community led approaches

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Historical data provides useful ecological context

-   Parks have the capacity to provide cooling, regardless of historical land-use 

-   To improve environmental equity, green space development must be community led and paired with stronger housing regulations
